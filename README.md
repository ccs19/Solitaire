Solitaire
Author: Christopher Schneider
=========

A working Java solitaire game.

This was a school project without a lot of time and my first ever program with a GUI. It's "complete" but there are
several issues.

You may use the code however you'd like, though I'd ask for you to give me credit. There are some poor design
decisions, but I think the code's fairly easy to interpret and fully documented.

=========

Known bugs:

-Game is slow to load

-Save feature saves card images, so save files are large

-Cards disappear when dragged with mouse.

-No checks for left/right mouse clicks. Clicking with both buttons will make cards disappear.

-Sometimes cards may disappear, but I think that bug is fixed with the exception of the above =-D

-Bad design choice to use GridLayout makes game un-resizeable. Doesn't play well on low-res screens.

-Undoubtedly other bugs present :-)

(As a side note, if you just happen to be a student tasked with writing a Solitaire game
for a school project, use this for ideas and nothing else.)
